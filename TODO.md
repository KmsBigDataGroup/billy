- Connect notifications to errors state
- Replace moment with date-fns
- i18n
- AOT Compilation
- Edit modals in named router outlets
- Custom structural directive
- Create Tooltip directive for forms errors
- Remove `skipLibCheck`. [Issue](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/14324)

Low priority:
- Route transition animation 
- Cool select component
- Static routes with landing page

Long Future:
- Code splitting and lazy loading maybe
- Setup Sentry.js in production
- Reading uploaded PDFs with Mozilla's pdf.js
